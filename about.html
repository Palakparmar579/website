        <h1 id="a10"><b><i>Our Story</i></b></h1>
        <p>Every great brand begins with a purpose — and Infinity was no different.<br>It all started with a simple question:<b>
        “Why is it so hard to find original, high-quality men’s fashion that actually fits and feels right?”</b><br>From that question, Infinity was born — with a mission to 
        create a space where men can shop confidently, without worrying about fakes, poor quality, or outdated styles.<br>Founded by a team of fashion-forward minds and business thinkers, Infinity began as a small idea in a shared workspace. Armed with a laptop, a clear vision, and a passion for style, 
        we sourced our first batch of shirts — handpicked for fit, fabric, and finish. What followed was pure momentum.<br>
        ✅ To bring only 100% authentic men’s products<br>✅ To offer fashion that balances comfort with confidence<br>✅ To build a shopping experience that’s smooth, fast, and personal<br>
        Today, Infinity is trusted by thousands of men across the country, with new customers joining every day — not just for the clothes, but for the culture of originality and trust we stand for.
